# Ge0 Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** July 27, 2025

Ge0 (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Ge0 uses and discloses information when you use our iPad GIS viewer app, now powered by Mapbox.

1. Map Rendering & External Requests
Mapbox Maps SDK
To display map tiles and map controls, Ge0 uses the Mapbox Maps SDK. When you view a map, the SDK requests map data (tiles, style definitions, etc.) from Mapbox servers.
What Mapbox may collect
Mapbox may receive your device’s IP address, approximate location (to serve the correct map tiles), and basic usage information (e.g. which map style or zoom levels you request). This is strictly for delivering map content and is governed by Mapbox’s own Privacy Policy (https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy/).
No additional sharing
Ge0 does not share any further personal data with Mapbox beyond what the SDK automatically transmits.
2. Local File Access
GeoJSON files
When you import GeoJSON files, Ge0 reads them directly from your device’s storage. We do not upload your files to any server.
3. Location Display
On‑device only
Your device’s current location (the “blue dot”) is displayed locally in the app. We do not send, log, or store your location data on our servers.
4. Analytics & Crash Reporting
No third‑party analytics
We do not integrate any analytics, crash‑reporting, or telemetry SDKs of our own.
Mapbox telemetry
Mapbox’s SDK may collect anonymous usage metrics to improve their service (e.g. tile load performance). This telemetry is controlled by Mapbox and subject to their policy—not ours.
5. Data Retention
No personal data storage
Ge0 does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on our servers. All data—map tiles (cached by Mapbox SDK), GeoJSON files, and your location display—remain on your device.
