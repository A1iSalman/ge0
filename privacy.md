# Ge0 Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** July 27, 2025

Ge0 is a solo‑developer app created and maintained by Ali Salman. This Privacy Policy explains how I use and disclose information when you use my iPhone GIS viewer app, now powered by Mapbox.

1. Map Rendering & External Requests
Mapbox Maps SDK
To display map tiles and map controls, GE0 uses the Mapbox Maps SDK. When you view a map, the SDK requests map data (tiles, style definitions, etc.) from Mapbox servers.

What Mapbox may collect
Mapbox may receive:

Your device’s IP address
An approximate location (to serve the correct map tiles)
Basic usage information (e.g., which map style or zoom levels you request)
All such data is collected solely by Mapbox to deliver map content, and is governed by Mapbox’s Privacy Policy:
https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy/

No additional sharing
I do not share any further personal data with Mapbox beyond what the SDK automatically transmits.

2. Local File Access
When you import GeoJSON files, Ge0 reads them directly from your device’s storage. I never upload your files to any server.

3. Location Display
Your device’s current location (the “blue dot”) is displayed entirely on‑device. I do not send, log, or store your location data on any server.

4. Analytics & Crash Reporting
No third‑party analytics
I do not integrate any analytics, crash‑reporting, or telemetry SDKs of my own.
Mapbox telemetry
Mapbox’s SDK may collect anonymous usage metrics (e.g., tile load performance) to improve their service. That telemetry is managed by Mapbox under their policy—not mine.
5. Data Retention
Ge0 does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on my servers. All data—map tiles (cached locally by the Mapbox SDK), imported GeoJSON files, and your on‑device location display—remains solely on your device.

6. Contact
If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or how Ge0 handles your data, please email me at:

Thank you for using GE0!
